# Entity Class (POCO)

The classes in this library are generated by the EntityFramework tool command **Scaffold-DbContext**. These classes are the plain-old CLR objects (POCO) representing the tables and views in the database.

The idea of a POCO is that these classes are more or less independent of the underlying database providers. By using the EntityFramework configuration API, the classes and properties can be mapped to the corresponding tables and columns of different database provider.
