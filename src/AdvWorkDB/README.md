# EntityFramework DBContext

The database context code in this library are generated by the EntityFramework tool command **Scaffold-DbContext**. All the entity configuration code in this project are using the fluent API. These configurations can be split into separate class per entity or all/some can be placed within the database context class.

The generated code provide an opportunity to learn how entities should be constructed and which configuration API should be used to design/describe the database tables and columns.

Many of the configuration API are extension methods within these assemblies. Use the Object Explorer to discover more of these API extension methods.

**Independent of database providers**:

- Assembly : Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational
	- Class : Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.RelationalEntityTypeBuilderExtensions

- Assembly : Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
	- Class : Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContextOptionsBuilder

**Database provider-specific**:

- Assembly : Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
	- Class : Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServerKeyBuilderExtensions

# Data Access Layer

Note, all the entity classes and the DBContext class should be considered as components of the data access layer. These classes should not be treated as business components or view model components.

The DBContext maintains an open database connection, and therefore, such connection should be managed accordingly. Open database connection should be closed as soon as possible once database operations have been completed.
